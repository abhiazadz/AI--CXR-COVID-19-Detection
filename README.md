# DL based COVID-19 Detection on Chest radiographs

The availability of the test kits was one of the major issues during the pandemic. The laboratories being packed for testing it was difficult to get the results quickly and often caused delay which increased the spread of the virus and delay in the proper treatment.  

In this projcet I have discussed and implemented AI based technique for COVID-19 detection on Chest radiographs using Deep learning segementation (using Unet architecture) and classificaiton (using transfer learning).
